> ClawAegis builds a multi-dimensional, defense-in-depth runtime security architecture for OpenClaw-style agents, implementing five-layer defense across the full lifecycle of LLM agents in various Claw environments — from initialization to execution — covering security and reliability risks in agent execution services, including skill poisoning, memory contamination, intent misalignment, malicious execution, and resource exhaustion. As a lightweight built-in security plugin, ClawAegis proactively triggers defense mechanisms at critical OpenClaw stages to dynamically safeguard agent runtime security. It also provides configurable risk identification and response policies for security operators to flexibly and extensibly address agent runtime threats, as well as sensitive file and skill asset protection for everyday users to safeguard personal privacy and assets.

</p>

ClawAegis builds a multi-dimensional, defense-in-depth architecture for OpenClaw, forming a complete security closed loop across the full lifecycle from initialization to execution. The system consists of five core defense layers:

- **Foundation Scan Layer** — Ensures the trustworthiness of the underlying environment, establishing a solid security foundation from the initialization stage.
- **Perception Input Layer** — Strictly filters and audits both internal and external instructions, intercepting malicious injections and high-risk requests.
- **Cognitive State Layer** — Monitors the agent's internal state in real time, preventing memory corruption and context contamination.
- **Decision Alignment Layer** — Validates intent during the logic generation phase to ensure output decisions align with the user's true intent. Ambiguous instructions require secondary user confirmation to eliminate intent deviation risks.
- **Execution Control Layer** — Enforces permission management before final operations, ensuring all instructions execute within controlled security boundaries.

Through this layered, progressive mechanism, ClawAegis ensures that OpenClaw possesses fine-grained risk mitigation capabilities at every critical link in the chain, neutralizing potential threats before they materialize. Furthermore, as a built-in security plugin — unlike passive defense mechanisms such as prompt-based or skill-based defenses — ClawAegis can proactively trigger defense mechanisms at critical OpenClaw stages, dynamically safeguarding runtime security.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**1.** Clone ClawAegis:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antgroup/ClawAegis.git
```

**2.** Install the plugin:

```bash
openclaw plugins install ./ClawAegis
```

**3.** (Optional) Enable ClawAegis with observe mode for safe rollout:

```json
{
  "allDefensesEnabled": true,
  "defaultBlockingMode": "observe"
}
```

**4.** (Optional) Promote high-confidence defenses to `enforce` as needed:

```json
{
  "allDefensesEnabled": true,
  "defaultBlockingMode": "observe",
  "selfProtectionMode": "enforce",
  "commandBlockMode": "enforce",
  "memoryGuardMode": "enforce",
  "exfiltrationGuardMode": "enforce"
}
```

## ✨ Features

### Runtime Defense

ClawAegis provides a set of built-in runtime defenses that cover the full agent lifecycle. These defenses detect and mitigate threats automatically without requiring additional configuration.

- **Five-Layer Defense-in-Depth** — Covers intent scanning, tool call governance, tool result inspection, asset protection, and output safeguarding across nine OpenClaw lifecycle hooks.
- **Skill Poisoning Defense** — Scans skill content at startup and continuously, detecting malicious payloads that attempt to bypass approval, disable safety controls, or tamper with protected assets.
- **Memory Contamination Guard** — Rejects suspicious or oversized writes to persistent memory stores (`memory_store`, `MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `memory/`), preventing persistent prompt poisoning across sessions.
- **Intent & Prompt Safety** — Detects jailbreak attempts, secret-exfiltration requests, and plugin-tampering intent in user messages, then injects safety context into prompts to influence subsequent model reasoning.
- **Tool Call Governance** — Blocks high-risk shell commands, encoded/obfuscated payloads, write-then-execute chains, repeated mutation loops, and SSRF/exfiltration chains before tool execution.
- **Tool Result Inspection** — Treats external tool outputs as untrusted input, scanning for prompt-injection, secret-request, and escalation patterns before they affect the next reasoning step.
- **LLM Prompt Sanitization** — Detects and optionally rewrites secrets, API keys, email addresses, and phone numbers before outbound `message_sending` content reaches the LLM.
- **Output Redaction** — Masks API keys, tokens, and similar sensitive values before assistant output is sent or stored.

### Advanced Configurable Defense

Beyond the built-in runtime defenses, ClawAegis gives security operators and end users a configurable control surface for advanced risk management and asset protection.

- **Configurable Security Operations** — Operators can enable all defenses globally with `allDefensesEnabled`, set a fleet-wide baseline with `defaultBlockingMode`, and override individual controls such as `selfProtectionMode`, `commandBlockMode`, `memoryGuardMode`, and `exfiltrationGuardMode`. Each defense supports `enforce`, `observe`, and `off` modes, enabling staged rollout from monitoring to active blocking. Operators can also define `protectedPaths`, `protectedSkills`, and `protectedPlugins` to match the assets that matter in their environment, and use `startupSkillScan` to identify risky skills early. Detections are surfaced as runtime observations, blocked actions, and promoted prompt warnings, giving defenders actionable signals for triage and response.
- **Sensitive Files and Skill Asset Protection** — Sensitive files and directories can be added to `protectedPaths` to block or observe unauthorized reads, writes, deletes, and tampering. High-value skills and important plugins can be registered via `protectedSkills` and `protectedPlugins` to prevent deletion, overwrite, or patch-based mutation of skill and plugin assets. Self-protection reduces the chance that the agent disables its own defenses or silently rewrites security configuration. For personal users, this means safer handling of private notes, documents, and custom skills; for organizations, it means stronger protection for operational runbooks, audit plugins, and security-critical configuration.

## 🎬 Visualization

OpenClaw can be deployed locally by individual users or remotely by service providers — both scenarios introduce distinct security risks. The demos below illustrate how ClawAegis defends against real-world threats in each context.

### For Individual Users (To C)

Locally deployed agents face risks from ambiguous intent, resource waste, and skill poisoning that directly impact the user's files, tokens, and privacy.

## 🔭 Future Work

- Provenance-aware trust scoring for skills, memory entries, tool outputs, and generated scripts, enabling policies that react to origin and historical behavior.
- Cross-session and cross-agent attack graphing to correlate risky intent, tool calls, tool results, memory writes, and outbound requests into unified incident timelines.
- Adaptive policies that automatically tune `observe` and `enforce` decisions based on deployment environment, task type, and operator feedback.
- Autonomous containment workflows that quarantine risky skills, freeze sensitive memory namespaces, and recommend recovery actions.
- Shared safety state for multi-agent systems, enabling collaborating agents to exchange risk context and coordinate containment.
- Continuous red-team evaluation pipelines that replay emerging jailbreaks, encoded payloads, skill-poisoning samples, and tool-chain abuse techniques against new releases.
- Explainable defense reports that translate low-level detections into human-readable incident summaries and reusable response playbooks.
